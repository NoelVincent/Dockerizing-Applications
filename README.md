# Dockerizing Applications
Here, we will be Dockerizing Applications, creating and building and Docker image for the same and pushing the docker image to the Docker hub repositories.

# Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. 

Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work too.
You can learn more about the same in the [website.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)

# What Is a Container
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

# What Is a Dockerizing
Dockerizing is the process of packing, deploying, and running applications using Docker containers. You can use Docker to pack your application with everything you need to run the application (such as libraries) and ship it as one package - a container. Containers are created from images that specify their precise contents.
